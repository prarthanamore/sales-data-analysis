# Sales Data Analysis using Python

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze retail sales data to identify trends, patterns, and actionable business insights that can support data-driven decision making.

## Dataset
The analysis uses the Superstore Sales Dataset, which contains information about orders, products, customers, regions, and sales performance.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Key Analysis
- Analyzed yearly sales trends to evaluate overall business growth
- Examined monthly sales patterns to identify seasonality
- Identified top-selling products based on total revenue
- Compared sales performance across different regions

## Key Insights
- The West region generates the highest total sales, indicating strong regional performance.
- Sales exhibit clear seasonality, with peaks during November and December.
- A small number of products contribute disproportionately to total revenue, highlighting a Pareto (80/20) effect.
- Overall sales show an upward trend over the years, suggesting consistent business growth.
